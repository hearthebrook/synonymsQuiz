# Symomyms Quiz
# Overview

This project was a "Get to know TypeScript" project for me! I have played arund with some basic JavaScript in webdevelopment, and had heard that Typescript is an upcoming language tied closely to JavaScript so I decided to give it a try. 

For this project, I created a synonyms quiz web application that uses API calls to generate quiz questions. I used two APIs, a synonyms API as well as a random word API, to generate the multiple choice selection. This project had many parts and templates and at first it was hard to integrate the different pieces of the program but luckily, TypeScript makes it fairly easy to keep track of what's going on between the programs. 

Like I said, I wanted to learn TypeScript and this was the product. It was fun to work out how to access the information returned from the APIs as well as set up comparisons between different scripts. Overall I learned that TypeScript is a very useful language when it comes to web applications and can increase a pages functionality a lot while also allowing more structure in the set up. 

Here's a short demo of what I was able to accomplish.

- [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/api)

# Future Work

- Save users accuracy to a cloud data base so they can keep track of their score 
- Display something when they get the answer correct
- Prevent the exact word from showing up as a synonym option
- create a larger synonym wordbank to choose from
